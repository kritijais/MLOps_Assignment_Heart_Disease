MLOps ARTIFACTS AND DATA

==================================

1. Trained Model Artifacts (Crucial to ignore!)

These are generated by the 'src/training/train.py' script.

They are too large to store in Git and should be managed by MLflow or CI/CD.

2. MLflow Tracking Files

This is the local database and files created when you run the training script.

mlruns/
